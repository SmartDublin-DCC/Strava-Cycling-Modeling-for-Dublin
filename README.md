## Overview:

The Dublin Strava Cycling Model estimates the volume of cyclists in Dublin. It provides a micro level of bicycle traffic in the city.

The model integrates a variety of data sources, it uses statistical modeling techniques to combine data from Strava metro data, cycle counter data, and existing open-source data.

The model provides accurate estimates of cycling volumes on specific routes. Users can then gain insights into when, where, and how many people are cycling in Dublin.


## Impact:
We hope the model will accurately estimate cyclist volumes in Dublin, especially for route-based analysis. 

The results could help researchers, decision makers, and businesses understand cycling patterns without needing expensive cycle counter networks, saving millions of euros. The model's replicability also makes it valuable for other cities.
