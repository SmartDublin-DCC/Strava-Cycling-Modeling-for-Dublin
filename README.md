## Introduction

Planning for cycling infrastructure can be challenging due to the lack of detailed information on where and when people are biking. However, with the rise of crowdsourced data from platforms like Strava, cities now have the opportunity to gain insights beyond what traditional bike counters, such as the Eco-Counts used in Dublin, can provide.

Nevertheless, crowdsourced data doesn't fully represent the entire cycling population, which means there's still much we don't know about cycling trips. Without this knowledge, planning for cycling infrastructure can feel like working with one hand tied behind your back.

My project aims to fill this gap by comparing several years of Strava data with manual counts of cyclists in the context of Dublin.  The idea is to find the relationship between existing Cycle counters and Strava Metro data (while controlling for other factors), then generalise the relationship to all Strava Metro data.​ This is the first practice of its kind to analyze Dublin cycling trips in this way. 

The results show a strong correlation between Strava data and Cyclecounts in Dublin, indicating that Strava can be a good predictor of actual cycling figures at the route-specific level.

In this document, I will introduce the model, data sources, and results. I will also use ground truth data (cycle counts/manual counts) to validate my model predictions.

## Strava Metro

Strava is an American app for tracking physical exercise, primarily focusing on outdoor cycling and running activities using GPS data. As of 2023, Strava has 120 million registered users worldwide, according to [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/strava-statistics/).

[Strava Metro](https://metro.strava.com/) is Strava's official data platform. It contains downloadable anonymized Strava user geo-referenced and time-stamped activity data (including cycling, running, and walking). The data from the platform provides excellent granularity, offering high-resolution time dimensions that can be as specific as hours and covering almost every street in Dublin.

Strava Metro serves as a great example of how companies can present user-generated data on an open and intuitive platform, enabling researchers and decision-makers to access large amounts of high-quality activity data for valuable use cases.

## The Model and Data

To gain insights into where and when people are biking, one approach is to install more cycle counters on streets of interest in Dublin. However, this method presents several challenges: (1) it is too costly if a large amount of information is required, and (2) it can be difficult to find available and safe locations for additional cycle counters. So, is there another way to estimate the exact number of cyclists?

An important observation might answer this question. The observation is the high correlation between Strava data and cycle count data captured by cycle counters installed in Dublin. For example, below is a time-series line chart that compares both datasets for Seapoint, Dublin:

### Chart 1: Cycle Counter vs. Strava Trip Counts Over Time in Seapoint (2021-2023, Weekly Summed)

![Cycle Counter vs. Strava Trip Counts](Visulisations/1.png)

The graph shows a high correlation between the two datasets (0.92) for Seapoint. It also shows that the Strava data reflects the overall trends and seasonal changes of the ground truth value. Although Strava data represents only a subset of the total cyclists at this location, it's possible to use Strava data to estimate cycle counts based on their correlation.

The core question to answer then becomes: **By how much does Strava cycling trip count data represent the whole cycling population in Dublin?**

To answer this question, we develop a regression model that connects Strava cycling counts and actual cycle counts. After obtaining the relationship, we can then use it as a multiplier to extrapolate the actual cycling trips based on the widely available and highly granular Strava data.

Thus, we set the main independent variable as Strava cycling trip counts (`strava_count`) and the dependent variable of interest as the ground truth cycle counts (`cycle_counts`), which are the ground truth (correct) target values.

Cycle count data is sourced from data generated by cycle counters (EcoCounters) in various locations in Dublin. The data is available on [Dublinked](https://data.smartdublin.ie/dataset/?q=Cycle+count).

Strava cycling trip counts are downloaded from Strava Metro and matched with cycle counter locations.

There are also other factors that relate to the Strava data's representation of the whole cycling crowd since these factors can influence cycling behaviors. Therefore, the model includes additional factors as control variables to account for these influences. Below is a list of variables and their data sources:

### Table A: List of Control Variables

| Variable                         | Description                                                       |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Rain`                 | Rainfall, sourced from Met.ie                                      |
| Regions: `Regions_N`,`Region_NE`,`Region_SW`  | Geolocation of the point of interest: North, Northeast, Southwest |
| Months:`month_1`,`month_2`...                  | Months: January to December                                       |
| `CityCenter`             | Whether the location is in the city center (defined by the canal)  |
| `Bike\_Lanes`             | Whether the location has bike lane availability                   |

The model is a multiple linear regression model using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator.

The model is given by:

$$
\text{cycle\_counts} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{strava\_counts} + \beta_i \cdot \text{controls} + \varepsilon
$$

Where:
- $\text{cycle\_counts}$ is the dependent variable, the ground truth cycle count data.
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept.
- $\beta_i$ are the coefficients for each independent variable.
- $\text{controls}$ are the control variables, which include the variables in **Table A**.
- $\text{strava\_counts}$ are the independent variables, the trip counts from Strava.
- $\varepsilon$ is the error term.

The descriptive statistics in Table B summarize the data across three key variables: Actual cycle counts (`cycle_counts`), Strava cycle counts (`strava_counts`), and rainfall (`rain`). All the data are weekly aggregated. The dataset has 2,657 observations, which is the number of observations after removing missing values. The average actual cycle count is 5,450 with a high standard deviation of 5,303.81, indicating significant variability. The Strava cycle count has a mean of 439.16 and an even higher standard deviation of 547.53, showing a broad range of Strava activity levels across different times and locations. The weekly rainfall average is 13.87 mm.

The figure below visualizes the locations of existing cycle counters in Dublin. The map highlights that all cycle counters are located within DCC and DLR, with the majority of them positioned outside the city center, indicating a bias in the representation of locations in the sample data.

## Data Insights

The regression model shows that Strava trip counts have a significant and positive relationship with actual cycle counts. Specifically, the coefficient for `strava_counts` is approximately 6.0211, meaning that for each additional Strava trip recorded, the total cycle count increases by roughly 6 trips, holding all other variables constant. This strong correlation indicates that Strava data is a good predictor of overall cycling volumes at the route-specific level in Dublin.

Rainfall(`rain`) negatively affects cycle counts, with a coefficient of -13.6096, which suggests that for each millimeter increase in rainfall, there is a corresponding  14 nubmers decrease in cycling activity. This result aligns with the expectation that adverse weather conditions discourage cycling.

The regional dummy variables also provide insight into how different areas in Dublin affect cycling volumes. For instance, the positive coefficients for `Regions_S` and `Regions_SE` suggest that these areas have higher cycling volumes compared to the reference category, while negative coefficients for `Regions_N` and `Regions_NE` suggest lower cycling volumes.

The `CityCenter` variable has a positive coefficient, indicating that being in the city center is associated with higher cycling volumes, likely due to higher population density and more destinations within close proximity.

The coefficients for the summer months (e.g., June, July, August) are significantly positive, indicating higher cycling activity during these months. For example, the coefficient for June(`month_6`) is 1565.4265 , showing a substantial increase in cycling trips during this month.

Lastly, the presence of bike lanes (`Bike_Lanes`) significantly increases cycling activity, which underscores the importance of dedicated cycling infrastructure in promoting biking.




## Validation

Overall the model reached 87% accuracy on a train/test split excercise. Validation RMSE (OLS): 2213.0555 and Test RMSE (OLS): 2123.8221 are close to each other, indicating no overfitting issues observed.
Below is a visualization of how the model fits the values overall. The closer the data is to the red line the better the data is fitted by the model. The chart shows satisfying results for the model fit visually

### Chart 2: Actual vs. Predicted Values
![Actual vs. Predicted Values](Visulisations/2.png)



We validated the model predictions against actual cycling volumes for several locations, with the y-axis representing weekly values over the period 2021-2023.

For many locations, the model's predictions closely match the actual cycling volumes recorded by cycle counters. For example:

However, the model's accuracy decreased in locations closer to . For instance, the prediction was less accurate for Clontarf:

### Chat 6: Original vs Predicted Values (Guild)
![Guild](Visulisations/Guild.png)


### Chat 6: Original vs Predicted Values (Drumcondra)

![Drum](Visulisations/Drum.png)

We also validated the model against manual count data for two city center locations—Amien Street and IFSC, which are not included in the traning data. Those mannual count are from Dublin City Council official traffic counts. The table below summarizes the comparison:

### Table E: Validation With Mannual Counts (Amien St & IFSC)
| **Time & Location**       | **Strava Count** | **Manual Count** | **Predicted Value** | **Accuracy** |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| *2024 May 13-19*     |                  |                  |                     |                |
| **Amien St**       | 600              | 14342           | 20663           | 55.93%           |
| **IFSC**           | 615              | 13126           | 20755          | 41.88%            |

Here are some potentail causes of the inaccuracy results for some locations

1. Data Discontinuity Due to Roadworks​

2. Potential sensor issues:. For example, Castleknock Totem and Coast Road Totem recorded fewer cyclists than Strava data.​

3. Lack of counters in the City Centre leads to lower accuracy in City Centre areas.
   
## Use of the Model

To use this model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare Data: Collect and prepare the data, including combined Strava trip counts and control variables.
2. Apply Coefficients: Multiply each variable by its respective model coefficient.
3. Sum Results: Sum the results to estimate the total cycle counts.

### Example Calculation

To estimate the cycle counts for a week with the following conditions:

- **Strava trip count**: 100
- **Rain**: 2 units
- **Location**: North
- **Month**: June
- **Bike Lanes**: Yes (value = 1)

The calculation follows this formula:

$$
\text{Cycle\_counts} = 
\text{constant} + (\text{Strava\_trip\_count} \times \text{Coefficient}) + (\text{rain} \times \text{Coefficient}) + 
$$
$$
(\text{Area\_N} \times \text{Coefficient}) + (\text{month\_6} \times \text{Coefficient}) + 
(\text{Bike\_Lanes} \times \text{Coefficient})
$$

Substituting the specific coefficients from the model:

$$
\text{Cycle\_counts} = 
-5934.4661 + (100 \times 6.1157) + (2 \times -13.3057) + 
(-401.7894) + (1369.9557) + (1 \times 6710.9627)
$$

$$
\text{Cycle\_counts} = -5934.4661 + 611.57 - 26.6114 - 401.7894 + 1369.9557 + 6710.9627
$$

$$
\text{Cycle\_counts} = 2329.6215
$$

So, under these specific conditions, the estimated weekly cycle count is **2330**.


I have also interpolated the cycling trip values for several key cycleroutes in Dublin (Weekly figure). I have included the raw data in the Appendix. Below is a quick view of the results:

## Conclusion & key takeaways

1. In this report, I introduced a weekly prediction model for cycling volumes using Strava Metro data and other open sourced data.
2. The model demonstrates relatively high accuracy in predicting cycling volumes. However, due to data limitations, the model performs better for locations outside of the city center or when analyzing combined routes. It is less accurate for individual locations within the city center, making it best suited for route-based analysis.
3. This model can significantly empower those interested in understanding how many people are biking on specific routes during particular time periods in Dublin.
4. The model also effectively captures seasonal trends and variations in cycling activity, offering valuable insights into how cycling patterns change over time.
5. With further improvement and additional data sources, the model has the potential to support urban planning and infrastructure development by providing detailed insights into cycling behavior across the city.
